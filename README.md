# Io
This is a shameless plug of the io programming language:

http://iolanguage.org/

This repository here is an experimental fork of the language.
Some of the changes compared to the official language:

* Change from cmake to make (I like that more)
* Remove all addons
* Only build the static io binary
* Try to replace the addons with bindings written in io
